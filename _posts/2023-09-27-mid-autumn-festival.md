The Student Residence came alive with the vibrant and heartwarming spirit of the Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration on the evening of September 27, 2023. This cherished event brought together residents from all corners of the globe, including our beloved exchange students who are far away from their homes. Despite the distance, they found a sense of belonging and comfort, creating a true home away from home. 

## The Beauty of Mid-Autumn

The roundabout was adorned with enchanting lanterns and captivating booths representing different halls and international student societies. These decorations transformed the atmosphere into a magical and festive wonderland, evoking the essence of the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Hall 4’s booth, dazzled with shimmering tinsels and hand-crafted lanterns immediately caught the attention of all who entered the event. The booth became a hub of excitement, offering engaging activities such as guessing mooncake flavours and solving riddles, captivating everyone’s interest. The mooncakes, eagerly enjoyed by the participants, vanished within two hours, while the riddles added an extra layer of thrill to the overall experience.
