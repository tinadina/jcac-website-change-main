The final exam period has always been challenging for students, with stress, panic, and nervousness filling the atmosphere. Recognizing how tiring it could be for residents, Four-Unity understood the need for stress relief and moments of joy during this demanding period. Consequently, an exam energy station is a much-needed solution. During the first week of December 2023, Residents were invited to visit the table and enjoy various tempting sweets and revitalizing beverages. The selection of candies and snacks was carefully chosen to bring smiles and provide a much-needed break from the stresses of studying. In addition to distributing treats, Four Unity's members offered words of encouragement to residents, reminding them that they were not alone in their struggles and that their hard work would yield the desired results. This supportive gesture aimed to uplift residents' spirits and reassure them that they had a strong community behind them during this challenging period.
