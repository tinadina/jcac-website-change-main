On the first of November, the Jockey Club Academy Hall kicked off its Academian Talk Series with the first set of talks for the year, continuing the tradition into the 2023/2024 academic year. The event was not confined to the eloquent voices of Hall 4 alone; it beckoned all student residents to join this captivating intellectual voyage.

Preceding this grand event was a training session on October 11th, an appetiser of academic brilliance hosted by none other than the distinguished Professor Zachary Leung. A former coach of the CityU team for the HKU/HSBC case competition, Professor Leung's session served as the overture, setting the bar high for the main event.


## The Speakers

The inaugural session of the year centred on the thought-provoking theme, "Human Well-being and Innovation." Three Academians took centre stage, each weaving a distinctive tapestry of knowledge and insight.
