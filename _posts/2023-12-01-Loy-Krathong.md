On December 1st, 2023, JCAC Hall 4 celebrated the renowned Loy Krathongâ€™s Day. Organized by Marisa, Pai, and Darren, the celebration took place in the G/F Common room, aiming to honor Thailand's iconic and widely celebrated traditional event while promoting Thai culture within the hall.

## An Offering To The Water

Loy Krathong is a festival dedicated to honoring the Goddess of waters, expressing gratitude for the abundant supply she provides throughout the year, and seeking forgiveness for any harm caused to the waters by floating "Krathong" into the river. The event started with a short but informative presentation about Loy Krathong's Day. This presentation covered the festival's purpose, highlighting the customary practices and sharing exciting facts related to Loy Krathong's Day.

## Origami And Krathong

After that, participants partook in an origami activity: crafting a miniature version of "Krathongs." This engaging activity provided a pleasant diversion and served as a cheerful means to alleviate the tension preceding their final exams. Once they finished crafting their origami "Krathongs," attendees had the opportunity to virtually float them and convey their wishes.
