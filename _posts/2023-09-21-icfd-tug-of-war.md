On the evening of September 21st, our hall residents made a strong statement of strength and determination at the Tug-of-War tournament. The event involved participation from over 30 engaged and enthusiastic Academians.

## The Show of Strength

Facing fierce opponents, our teams achieved remarkable outcomes that filled our community with pride. Our female team demonstrated their prowess by securing a victory against Hall 8, propelling them to the quarter-finals. Although their journey concluded at that stage, their inspiring teamwork left a lasting impression.
