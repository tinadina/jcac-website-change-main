## The Hunt for the Poker Champion

With 25 participants, the enthusiasm among the residents was palpable. As the chips were stacked and bets were made, the competition grew intense. The games provided thrills, including an impressive “straight flush” hand, a rare combination with five cards of the same suit in a continuous sequence, that occurs only once out of every 72,193 hands.
