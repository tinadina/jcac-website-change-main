In late November, the second set of this year’s JCAC Academic Talk Series featured an exhilarating array of presentations on diverse academic themes, spearheading an intellectual journey into varied domains under the common theme of “Advancement in Technology and Society”. Opening its doors to not just Hall 4 students but also the broader resident community, the event allowed Hall 4 to demonstrate their academic streak to their neighbours. The event was preceded by a separate set of talks on the topic of “Human Well-being and Innovation,” which took place just one month prior.

The speakers all gave riveting and engaging presentations, evident in the fact that all three obtained scores of over 11 out of 15 in both the judging panel score and the audience panel score. Ultimately, we congratulate Adam for achieving the highest score for this event. We eagerly await similarly stimulating conversations, talks and engagements in the semester ahead!

The evening featured three Academians as speakers: Adam, Musab and Ayaulym. 

**Adam Sutherland GEAR**, who is in their second year and studies Computational Finance, illuminated the audience with insights on 'The Future of AI: Opportunity or Existential Risk?' His discourse ventured into the potential impacts of Artificial Intelligence on humanity, exploring its disruptive potential in both short-term disturbances and long-term existential risks. 

**ABDUR REHMAN Musab**, a Mechanical Engineering major, delved into 'Risk Engineering: Mitigating Uncertainties for a Safer Tomorrow.' Unveiling the core tenets of risk assessment, hazard identification, and the integration of risk management into engineering design, his talk underscored the pivotal role of risk engineering in fostering safety and sustainability across industries. 

**Ayaulym Abaikhanova**, a Civil Engineering major, presented 'Tokyo to Los Angeles: Designing Cities that Put People First,' offering insights into crafting walkable cities for enhanced urban life. Her exploration encompassed the challenges faced by cities like Los Angeles juxtaposed with the pedestrian-friendly environments of Tokyo and London, aiming to inspire innovative approaches for vibrant, people-centric urban landscapes and sustainable modern cities.
