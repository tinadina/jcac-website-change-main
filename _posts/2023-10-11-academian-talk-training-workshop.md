The workshop trainer was **Dr. Zachary Leung**, a distinguished speaker with a Ph.D. from MIT and six years of experience coaching the CityU case team. The workshop introduced the practical method for successful public speaking, known as the 4Ps method. Coined by Dr. Zachary Leung, the 4Ps emphasized four key stages: Process, Prepare, Present, and Postmortem. The straightforward approach of the 4Ps method not only captured the attendees' attention but also left them with knowledge and feeling empowered by the end of the workshop. 

The workshop also created an interactive environment where participants actively engaged by answering diverse questions and offering intriguing suggestions. This active participation impressed the trainer, Dr. Zachary Leung, and left fellow students in awe. As a result, participants gained valuable insights and practical strategies that they could immediately apply to enhance their public speaking skills.
