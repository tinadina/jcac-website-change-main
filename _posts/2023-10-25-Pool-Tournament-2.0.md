Amidst the demanding midterm season, JCAC residents found a delightful escape through a thrilling pool tournament held on the evenings of October 24th and 25th, 2023. Seeking to determine the hall’s finest pool player, the event took place in the inviting ambience of the JCAC Hall Pool room.

## Determining the Master of Pool

It provided a much-needed respite, allowing residents to unwind and rekindle their competitive spirits after a half-semester of socialising and academic endeavours. The tournament garnered an overwhelming response, drawing in a total of 32 enthusiastic participants from our hall. These eager competitors put their knowledge of playing pool to the test, resulting in an engaging spectacle of cue ball finesse and tactical manoeuvring.

## The Champions

After a spirited display of talent and determination, the top three residents emerged as champions: Huon secured the coveted first place, closely followed by Xavier in second place, and Jihoon clinched the honourable third place. What made this competition all the more exciting was that the final rankings were not decided by a single match but through a 'best of three' system, showcasing the consistency and depth of skill possessed by these talented individuals.
