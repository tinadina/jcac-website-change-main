On the 28th of December, our team from the Hall Residence Committee organised a truly memorable event for our residents. The purpose of the event was not only to celebrate Christmas but also to bid farewell to some of our academicians who will be going on an exchange program next semester.

The atmosphere was filled with joy and excitement as our Residence Master, Alvin Leung, warmly greeted all the residents and extended his congratulations for the ending of 2023 while wishing everyone the best for the upcoming year. Adding to the festive spirit, the responsible residence tutors and Mr. Alvin himself announced the results of the Cleanliness Competition, with the best floors receiving well-deserved gifts.

## Sharing is Caring

However, the highlight of the gathering was the celebration of Christmas and the opportunity to congratulate one another, spending quality time with friends. The Hall Residence Committee did an exceptional job of engaging us with captivating games and rewarding residents with exciting prizes. In between the games, some of our talented residents showcased their musical talents, singing and playing instruments, which truly elevated the atmosphere of this beautiful event.

As the event progressed, it was time to exchange gifts and well wishes for the New Year. Everyone brought thoughtful gifts, fostering a sense of camaraderie and joy as we exchanged them with one another.

## Hope for Better

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our Residence Committee for organising such a remarkable event. Their efforts in creating an inviting atmosphere and fostering deep emotional connections with the residents are truly appreciated.

In conclusion, we would like to extend our warm congratulations to everyone as we approach the new year. May you be surrounded by great individuals who share your interests, bringing brightness and fulfilment to your lives.
