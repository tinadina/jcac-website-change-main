With two types of soap bases available - transparent and opaque. The workshop also provided different base oils, enchanting fragrances, and pigments, allowing participants discovered the magic of using pigments to create captivating layers of colors. The addition of pigment makes ordinary soap look like a delicate dessert. It was like stepping into a candy wonderland!
