After intense training sessions, a total of 16 representatives from Hall 4 participated in this year's badminton inter-hall contest fun day. On October 2nd, our players arrived early at the venue to prepare. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the exciting badminton competition finally began. 

## The Singles Division

There were five matches in total: Men and Women's Singles, Men and Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. The match was against Hall 3. Our player in the Men's Singles was a strong and powerful player. Right from the beginning, the air was filled with an intense atmosphere, and our male player overwhelmed the player from other dorms with his excellent performance. 

Meanwhile, the female player in the Women's Singles also participated in a fierce match but unfortunately lost to the player from Hall 3. 

## Double the Trouble

The matches in Men's and Women's Doubles were also highly intense. Our players used solid defensive techniques, resulting in a close score difference. However, the opponents seemed to identify our playersâ€™ weaknesses and formulated powerful attacks. 

Unfortunately, we sadly lost a few rounds in the Men's and Women's Doubles matches, which failed to make it to the next stage in the tournament.

In the Mixed Doubles match, our team faced a challenging opponent who seemed to have stronger strategies.

Despite our players' full efforts, they regrettably lost to the opposing team. At the same time, our cheering team provided warm and deserved support to the Hall 4 players. This badminton competition made everyone feel like a part of the Hall 4 family. We will come back stronger next year!
